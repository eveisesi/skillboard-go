# Welcome to the Eve Is ESI Skillboard Repository

Skillboard is a Third Party Application written for the MMORPG Eve Online. It is part of the Eve Is ESI Brand and operates on one of it's subdomains.
Skillboard.Evie is a Golang Application. This repository contians the code for Skillboard Evie API as well as the processors and crons. This application
runs entirely inside of Docker with the exception of some minor setup that makes use of the main binary (there are plans to move this to a docker container
that'll be controlled by a combination of environment variables and redis queries)

### Setup

TBD
